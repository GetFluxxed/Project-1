# Pitch
So you found yourself trapped in a dungeon, how fitting. Well, to get out of this, you're gonna have to kill some things and chew some bubblegum. In this top-down side scroller, escape the dungeon while facing obstacles, enemy mobs, and -- defeat the one who probably put you there in the first place, known as ME (yes I am the end game boss, I put you there).

# MVP
The MVP for the dungeon, is going to be a single level, with an enemy and a few obstacles in the way. The enemy is going to fight back. If you get hit by the enemy, you will lose!!! You can also fall into the lava if you get a bit too scared of the enemy, which WILL ALSO CAUSE YOU TO LOSE!


# Stretch Goals
There are a lot of these. I'd like the game to be multiveled, able to move through doors, fight multiple mobs, and impliment an HP system. I'd like to create a semi-intuitive hit detection system for a sword / bow that the character can start off with. The main stretch goal though, is to add a darkness effect, such as a cascading shadow, that after a certain point cuts off vision, so you can't see what is ahead of you. Adding a story with an npc/some windows that give context to the area or story could be fun.


# Roadblocks
I encountered only a handfull of roadblocks, with the biggest one being the implementation of various sprites. I don't know why this was difficult for me, however, I was extremely excited to have overcome it and now understand simply how to link in a sprite. Now the next challenge for me to cover is the addition of procedural generation, and essentially refactoring all of my code to be more scalable and more efficient.


# Things to be Proud of
I was very proud of my understanding of OOP, adding the ability to hold items in a pseudo-inventory, and have prerequisites on enemies before you could fight them. I think overall, the design of my game massively improved with the additions of texture, going from a set of blocks, to a much more immersive dungeon floor, with flaming pits of lava.
