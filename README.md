# Pitch
So you found yourself trapped in a dungeon, how fitting. Well, to get out of this, you're gonna have to kill some things and chew some bubblegum. In this top-down side scroller, escape the dungeon while facing obstacles, enemy mobs, and -- defeat the one who probably put you there in the first place, known as ME (yes I am the end game boss, I put you there).

# MVP
The MVP for the dungeon, is going to be a single level, with an enemy and a few obstacles in the way. The enemy is going to fight back. If you get hit by the enemy, you will lose!!! 

# Stretch Goals
There are a lot of these. I'd like the game to be multiveled, able to move through doors, fight multiple mobs, and impliment an HP system. I'd like to create a semi-intuitive hit detection system for a sword / bow that the character can start off with. The main stretch goal though, is to add a darkness effect, such as a cascading shadow, that after a certain point cuts off vision, so you can't see what is ahead of you.
